# A blog appears!
So I guess I have a blog now :3

I'm not too sure how often I'm gonna use this but from time to time I'll throw up a post about something interesting I find or something I struggled to find a good guide for.

### But what's it made of?
The stack is pretty simple, consisting of three main things.
1. [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/) - The main bread and butter, its what turns the markdown files into pretty pages.
2. [GitHub (Pages)](https://pages.github.com/) - I use GitHub for both the source repo and static web hosting.
3. [giscus](https://giscus.app/) - The comment service provider, its open source and uses GitHub's discussions feature.

You can find the source for this site on [GitHub](https://github.com/JustPyrrha/blog).

### Art Credits :heart:
Both the Home art and the favicon were commissioned from Peachii!
Go show them some love:

Thanks for reading! Hopefully I'll be posting a lot more here soon!\
